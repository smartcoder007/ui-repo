1) To create a new workspace and an initial app project:
     >ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
	 
2)	Serve the application
     >cd angular-tour-of-heroes
	 >ng serve --open
    The --open flag opens a browser to http://localhost:4200/	 
	

Angular components :
-------------------
	
	1)The page you see is the application shell. The shell is controlled by an Angular component named AppComponent.
	2)Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.
	3)You'll find the implementation of the shell AppComponent distributed over three files:

		app.component.ts— the component class code, written in TypeScript.
		app.component.html— the component template, written in HTML.
		app.component.css— the component's private CSS styles.	

app.component.html
  <h1>{{title}}</h1>  - The double curly braces are Angular's interpolation binding syntax.

Create the heroes component
---------------------------
ng generate component heroes

app/heroes/heroes.component.ts

---START----

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-heroes',
  templateUrl: './heroes.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./heroes.component.css']
})
export class HeroesComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}

-----END----



1)You always import the Component symbol from the Angular core library and annotate the component class with @Component.

2)@Component is a decorator function that specifies the Angular metadata for the component.

3)The CLI generated three metadata properties:

selector— the component's CSS element selector
templateUrl— the location of the component's template file.
styleUrls— the location of the component's private CSS styles.


1)The CSS element selector, 'app-heroes', matches the name of the HTML element that identifies this component within a parent component's template.
2)The ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook. Angular calls ngOnInit shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.
3)Always export the component class so you can import it elsewhere ... like in the AppModule.

<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<app-heroes></app-heroes>
