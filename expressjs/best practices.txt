Always begin a node project using npm init.
Always install dependencies with a --save or --save-dev. This will ensure that if you move to a different platform, you can just run npm install to install all dependencies.
Stick with lowercase file names and camelCase variables. If you look at any npm module, its named in lowercase separated with dashes. Whenever you require these modules, use camelCase.
Dont push node_modules to your repositories. Instead npm install everything on development machines.
Use a config file to store variables
Group and isolate routes to their own file. For example, take the CRUD operations in the movies example we sawin REST API page.
